# Difficulty Bomb Defusal Patch Proposals

If you are ready to submit a git diff of a working patch or have a
working patch detailed in a technical write-up add the document to this
folder.

Once discussion of how the patch works, and if it introduces any other
affects concludes info from the discussion and the patch details can be combined
to create an EIP.

The EIP will be announced to the wider community, and if they accept the
changes it will be immediately implemented in all Ethereum classic clients
maintained by the Ethereum Project.
