Public plan for the disposal of 'the bomb', tests, and ice age prevention

The need for a stable code to neutralize the difficulty equation known as 'the bomb' or 'ice age' has been suggested. This code will give the ETC community the option of having a 'switch' to prevent the unwanted effects of high mining time if, so needed.

Branches will be formed on indivdual core projects for bomb disposal. 

###Task 1 
  - Identify the exponential difficulty code in each project

###Task 2
  - Find way to Render the code harmless by deletion or circumvention

###Task 3 
  - Add 'DIEHARD' fork code to accomplish task 2 at a predetermined block number for a universal sync transition
  
###Task 4
  - Testing


Once testing is complete and the code is ready, create an EIP to present the tested plan to the wider community. If accepted add the new code to all the Ethereum classic clients.

##The Bomb

```block_diff = parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99) + int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))```

The first part of the algorithm, ```parent_diff + parent_diff // 2048 * max(1 - (block_timestamp - parent_timestamp) // 10, -99)```, is in charge of adjusting the difficulty based on the elapsed time between prior blocks. It makes incrimental adjustments up or down to reach a mean time between blocks of  ~15 sec

The second part of the algorithm , ```+ int(2**((block.number // 100000) - 2))```, is "the bomb". It doubles its difficulty every 100000 block, forever, until the the blocks are to difficult to solve in a reasonible time.


##Option 1
Disabling the second part of the algorithm removes the bomb and ~14 is the target time forever. 

##Option 2
###Kick the Can Method #1  

Change the fuse 

```((block.number // 100000) - 2)``` 

```block.number``` is the current block number

```100000``` sets the pace of the bomb. This is 'the fuse' A larger number would slow the bomb down. 

The ```- 2``` in the algo was originally set as "the bomb" was not to be engaged until after block 200000.    

###Kick the Can Method #2

Reset the delay

the ```- 2``` in the algo was originally set as "the bomb" was not to be engaged until after block 200000.Changing this number to a higher number allows the bomb to be delayed. i.e. ```-50``` would reset and delay the bomb from starting until block 50000000
